WPC Smart Product Collections allows you to manage product collections in the easiest.

== Description ==

We gladly introduce a new way to manage your products, which saves you a great deal of time and effort. Forget about creating tags, categories, brands, or attributes. Create some product collections instead. It’s an easier way to manage products and get ready for other activities at no time.

What makes it distinguishable from other product management types is that users can create collections then let this plugin automatically do the labor work for their site. Collections can be accessed from under Products >> Collections and there is a comprehensive list of conditions for setting compulsory rules for each collection.

The pending time is based on how large your store is: the bigger, the longer. It takes some time for our plugin to find matched products to add into collections, users can still finish the process manually if they don’t want to wait.

Product collections created by WPC Smart Product Collections for WooCommerce plugin will be utilized as a type of source for other WPC plugins to filter matched products for Smart Bundles/Grouped/Composite, product timers, badge management, linked variations, etc.; thus, users can take full advantage of plugins in the WPC ecosystem.
